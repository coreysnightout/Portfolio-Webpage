          <p>I am a student at Epicodus, and I am learning how to become a front end web developer. I am now one week into my learning and it has been a crazy one at that. I would say <em>"stress"</em> is the most commonly used word from my vocabulary within this time frame. I joined epicodus because I felt I needed some reinforcement to get into coding. I graduated from Cal State University of Northridge with a BA in graphic design, but was strictly a print designer. Posters, logos and mock-ups were what I knew, and with a rapidly growing design world in digital media, i knew i had to gain more knowledge in web design and web developing. I love ice hockey, music and backpacking so I hope I can use my growth at Epicodus to find a career at a company that has the same interests and values as I do, such as; <strong>Columbia Sportswear</strong>, <strong>Poler Stuff</strong>, <strong>Nike</strong>, or the <strong>Winterhawks Organization</strong>. I currently work at Trader Joe's as a sign artist for the store, which includes tasks like designing and creating chalkboard art, or large murals for the walls inside the store. However, I feel ready to move up to the next step of my creative ability and push myself to learn how to successfully develop websites and apps. <strong>Below</strong> I will showcase all that I have learned in the past four days. Below is a list of sample projects that I have been working on at Epicodus so far.</p>

        <h5>- Mogwai -</h5>
        <p>This project was to create a band page practicing implementing columns, floating and adding borders around text. Calvin and I kept it very simple, adding just one large picture and a large header to attract the viewer. The directions told us to make a tour dates list and float the list to one side of the page while giving it a background color, padding and a border. Mogwai is a post-rock, jazz fusion and electronica band from Scotland, and they are one of my favorite bands to date. It was a lot of fun building a simple site like this for that reason. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/coreysnightout/Mogwai">link to the Github</a>.

        <h5>- Wikipedia -</h5>
        <p>This project was to re-create (as best we could) the Wikipedia page with our understanding of bootstrap, columns and grids. We also learned how to download bootstrap to the computer and open their file of bootstrap.css and copy and paste it to our own bootstrap.css in our css folder. We played with tabs and panels through the bootstrap css and also colors that we could add to them. Challenges were getting the columns to line up from left to right without interfering with eachother. You can check out the git hub <a href="https://github.com/coreysnightout/Wikipedia">here</a>.

        <h5>- Gory Cupcakes -</h5>
        <p>Gory Cupcakes was a website Calvin and I created for a bakery that makes obsene, disgusting and graphic sweets. The site helped us work on building multiple pages within the site, creating a few different .html pages that a real bake shop would need to have a successful online business. We created the index (home) page, menu page, gallery page and locations page. We played around with uploading images to the site and getting a familiarity with the options that are available to you when at the first stages of building a website. you can check out the github page <a href="https://github.com/coreysnightout/Gory-Cupcakes">here</a>.

        <h5>- Interesting Garbage -</h5>
        <p>Interesting garbage was a funny site to make. We were told to make a blogging site and to have a few posts on the page. We thought interesting garbage could be a fun blog to create, because you never know what you may find. We also were told to practice our styles editing and to throw in some span elements into the html. This page also warmed us up for getting used to div classes and how they can decrease time and energy spent on creating the website.
